                    co-signers on loan... what examples do we need for this?</p>
                <p id=x070 class=irc><cite>&lt;Orie_&gt;</cite> I meant a single spec example, with multiple issuers</p>
                <p id=x071 class=irc><cite>&lt;andres&gt;</cite> gotcha</p>
                <p id=x072 class=irc><cite>&lt;Orie_&gt;</cite> the @context allows multiple issuers, and that is what
                    is signed over in both representations.</p>
                <p id=x073 class="phone s06"><cite>dlongley:</cite> Agree with most of what Brent said, but maybe
                    disagree w/ having multiple IDs... what spec says today doesn't allow multiple issuers. Don't think
                    it's actually supported today, if people want a change, that needs to happen before CR.</p>
                <p id=x074 class="phone s01"><cite>brent:</cite> does this need to change before CR, any volunteers?</p>

                <p id=x076 class="phone s01"><cite>brent:</cite> multi-issuer VCs could be one way, but not the only

                <p id=x077 class=irc><cite>&lt;Orie_&gt;</cite> yep, multi issuer and multi subject are both related /
                    required for some scenarios</p>
                <p id=x078 class=irc><cite>&lt;Orie_&gt;</cite> but afaik, nobody is using them (either).</p>
                <p id=x079 class="phone s03"><cite>JoeAndrieu:</cite> I'd be hard pressed to understand how that would
                    work.</p>
                <p id=x083 class="phone s05"><cite>manu:</cite> Just to highlight, I don't think that's an issue, Phil.
                    You can always do multi-issuer by issuing multiple VCs. That may be distasteful in some cases but it
                    works. You can have two VCs claiming a child, and so on.</p>
                <p id=x084 class="phone s05"><cite>manu:</cite> We're covered as far as use cases are concerned, the
                    question is, is that the most ideal form. To be clear, I don't think we need to deal with this in
                    2.0.</p>
                <p id=x085 class="phone s07"><cite>pdl-ASU:</cite> Very good.</p>

                <p id=x088 class="phone s01"><cite>brent:</cite> ok, so suggestion that this is not a VC2.0 thing -- do
                    we mark pending close, or mark future?</p>
                <p id=x089 class="phone s03"><cite>JoeAndrieu:</cite> Do you want to keep this around, Phil?</p>
                <p id=x090 class="phone s07"><cite>pdl-ASU:</cite> I just want to make sure we consider this in v3.0...
                    however we keep it around is good.</p>
                <p id=x094 class="phone s05"><cite>manu:</cite> I guess the only concern I have with keeping it around
                    is that our issuer tracker ends up collecting a lot of cruft over time. Things that are continuously
                    not addressed. If this is an important enough use case it will be raised again saying they want the
                    spec changed. My preference is to close as many issues as possible if they haven't been worked on.
                </p>
                <p id=x095 class="phone s05"><cite>manu:</cite> The WG has been operating since 1.0 and 2+ years since
                    then and no one hasn't worked on it. The history will still be there if we close it.</p>
                <p id=x096 class="phone s07"><cite>pdl-ASU:</cite> I will check with some people I know doing
