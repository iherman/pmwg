# PMWG minutes?

* TOC
{:toc}

A pad for the W3C Publishing Maintenance Working Group Minutes (if it works?)

Just testing whether this could be used to take minutes, and use that in place of the IRC based mechanism. The idea is that the minute taker would take the minutes here, using more or less the same style as before, i.e,

someone: this and this and this, just type in the minuted text as is...

But people can use the same place to make corrections, etc. The pad has a separate chat field to get side conversations (if necessary).

The idea would be to create a separate pad of the form "pmwg-2023-06-10"; at the end of the call, the minute exported as HTML (or store as markdown) and uploaded to the WG's github repository. Alternatively, as the pmwg will not have that many meetings, we can maintain a single pad for the full WG (to be discussed).

## Topic on something here

### And even subtopics are possible

The pas allows to create

1. Numbered list
2. like this

or

- bullet lists
- like this

Because, in fact, this is simply Markdown!!! Which makes it easy to do all kinds of things??? Yes!

Somebody could also put in "out of band" comment like this:

> this is an out-of-band comment by John Doe

> I can add a reply from Peter Someone

## Another topic here

### with its own subtopic

or intended lines

This is just markdown, so `code` works, as well as links, like https://www.w3.org becoming links automatically, though... and [markdown style links](https://www.ivan-herman.net) work, too!


### and another subtopic
Thoughts

The meeting could use the zoom tools to raise hands (not sure that is usable for Avneesh and George, though...)
